            inventory monitoring, and management of violations and
            liabilities of the laboratories in the University of San Carlos
            Department of Computer Engineering. The system is a web-
            based open source application that records inventory entries
            and transactions, generates liability and violation reports from
            inventory transactions and user records. The developers used
            PHP, Javascript, JQuery, MySQL database, and CodeIgniter
            framework as backend development technologies. HTML5,
            CSS3, and the framework Bootstrap were used to develop the
            User Interface of the system. From the data population and
            user transactions recorded, the system can generate statistical
            report, and printable documents.</p>
